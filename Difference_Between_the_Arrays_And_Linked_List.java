          Arrays                                                   Linked List

  1. Array is a group of data elements                1. Linked list is a group of entities(Node)
       of similar data type.                              Node = data and address.

  2. Data stores in contiguous                        2. Data is not stored in contiguous
      memory location.                                   memory location ( stored randomly).

  3. Memory size is Fixed.                            3. Linked list is dynamic in size.

  4. We can access elements easily                    4. In linked list elements accessing needs to
      and faster.                                         the traversal of whole linked list.

  5. In array deletion and insertion                  5. Here insertion and deletion operation
      takes more time as compare to                       is faster.
      linked list.

  6. Memory is assigned at compile time.              6. Memory is assigned at run time.

  7. Elements of arrays are not dependent                7. Elements of linked list is dependent
     on each other.                                       on each other.
